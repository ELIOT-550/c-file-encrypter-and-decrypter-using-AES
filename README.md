first step download the .net sdk from here https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download and check if it was installed perfectly open cmd and type [dotnet --version] if a version number appears then its working perfectly


second step navigate to the fileencrypter directory from cmd and type [dotnet run]

in the same cmd page you will need to insert the full directory url to encrypt the files in it

by following these steps you will be able to encrypt your files 

note if you want to decrypt the files do the same thing but with the filedecrypter folder

{happy coding}ðŸ˜Š
